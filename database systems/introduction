1. Databases should follow ACID
	a. Atomic
	b. Consistency
	c. Isolation -> only the user
	d. Durability -> Any stored data must be protected from failures
	
2. Database is a collection of related data
	Data: is recorded facts with meaning
	Metadata: data about data (time of creation, size of data, etc etc)
	
3. Database Management System is a software package designed to store and manage large databases with complex features and relations

4. The goal is to store and retrieve database information conveniently and efficiently

5. Database is a very large integrated collection of structured data

6. They model real world entities

(Problem stating: Create a file-handling based program to store semester grades in files and ask a menu driven program of a particular student and semester, and show the particular cg)

7. Database system is the DB software together with the data itself
