Initial computers:
	1. control unit,
	2. ALU, <- I/o
	3. Ram
	
Bell Labs invented transsistor in 1947 by william shockley
	1. Replaced vacuum tubes
	2. Smaller, cheaper, less heat, solid state, made from silicon
	
CPU in a chip -> microprocessors
	1. It came inside microcomputers
	2. Apple, Commodore, Intel
	
Intel 4004
	1. Used for business calculations
	2. 10 micrometre processors, 2300 in number
	3. 400-800 khz
	4. 4-bit word size
	5 16-pin DIP package
	6. Made from hand-cut masks

Intel 8080, 8086/8088/Pentium

Embedded systems
	1. Microprocessor or microcontroller based system of hardware and software designed to perform dedicated functions within a largetr mechanical or electrical systems
	Advantages
		1. Improve performance
		2. Reduce cost
		3. Improve reliability
		4. Added Network connectivity
		
Motherboard
	1. Backbone of the system
	2. Has ports to connect to cpu and memory, buses and connectors and ports
