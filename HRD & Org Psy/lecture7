training design
	1. active practice vs mental practice
	2. massed vs spaced practice sessions
	3. whole vs part learning
	4. over-learning
	5. feedback/ knowledge of results
	6. task sequencing
	
retention of what is learned
	1. meaningfulness of material ("i attended physics lecture but studied maths".....this is not a meaningful retention)
	2. degree of original learning
	3. interference
	
transfer of training
	1. If the training is transferable (students teaching anohter people)
	2. general principles
	3. stimulus variability
	4. support in the work environment (favourable and motivating people towards the training programs)
	5. opportunity to perform (getting the work you learned about, or actively seeking such work)
	6. Transfer-of-training climate
	
The above are modeled by baldwin and ford (1988)

pedagogy vs andragogy
	1. pedagogy is just one way talking, more like listening to radio..no interaction between students
	2. andragogy: two way communication with everyone. this is more interactive
	
Attribute-treatment interaction
	2 variables
		cognitive ability, motivation
	
	cognitive resource allocation theory:
		ghots perform better than non-ghots during declarative knowledge phase
		motivation efforts reduces performance during declarative knowledge bcoz such efforts competes with knowledge resources for attention
		
Training adults and older workers
	they are mostly self-driven
	adults ahve acquired a large amount of knowledge and exp that can be tapped as a resource for learning
	they have a greater readiness to learn in order to solve problems or address needss
