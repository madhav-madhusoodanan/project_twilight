learning in hrd
	A child that burns his/her hand learns not to play with it
	A mother at the place will know that children can do mistakes
	
conditioning
	Classical conditioning -> experiment of dog, food and bell done by ivan pavlov
	UCR -> unconditional response
	UCS -> unconditional stimuli
	CR -> conditional response
	CS -> conditional stimuli
	
Classical -> process of associating 2 stimuli
operant -> process of aossociating a response and its consequence

operant conditioning: associating behaviour with consequences (teaching a child to say "please")

Experiment: lab rat going through a maze to reach the cheese at the end
the time spent by the rats in trying to find the cheese reduces -> they are developing a mental model of the maze

learning is nothing but acquisition of knowledge
