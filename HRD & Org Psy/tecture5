(chapter 2: influences on employee behaviour)

Path-Goal Situations
	1. Situation
	2. Leader behaviour
	3. Impact on follower
	4. outcome
	
	Eg: followers lack self confidence -> leader encourages them -> their confidence is boosted -> More effort, satisfaction and performance
	
	Ambiguous jobs -> directive leadership ( clarify the path to goal )
	Lack of job challenge -> Achievement-oriented leadership (set high goals)
	Incorrect reward -> participative leadership -> clarify followers needs and change rewards
	
-------------------------------------

1. Transactional leaders
	(Contingent rewards): They give credit to people who participate, the performers
	(Management by exception): They look for exceptions and proposes corrective actions
	(passive typpe only intervenes if the standards are not met)
	Laissez faire method of decision-making, abdicates responsibilities
	
2. Transformational leaders
	1. (idealised influence or charisma):  provides vision and a sense of mission, instills pride and trust
	2. Inspirational motivation:communicates high expectations
	3. Intellectual stimulations
	4. Individual consideration
	
------------------------------

	Divergent thinking + convergent thinking
	Discussing and taking in variety of opinions, then compiling it and coming to a decision

Maaslow's hierarchy of needs
	1. physical needs (breathing, food, water, biological needs)
	2. safety needs (houses, reources, family)
	3. belonging (possession)
	4. self esteem 
	5. self-actualization
	
-----------------------------
Motivating factors
	acheivements recognition, work, responsibility, advancement, growth

Hygiene factors
	Company policy, supervision, relationship with boss, work conditions, salary, relationship with peers
	
	(salary is motivating factor only initially... if you have spent a lot of time there, then salary is just a hygiene factor)
	
easy way to distinguish: ask if these factors would motivate you

-----------------------------
social learning theory: you imbibe the habits of others in the organization
